# Project 2 - Huang, Justin

## Problem Statement
How do we know if a random number generator (RNG) is 'good'? In this project we test a number of Unif(0,1) generators. We evaluate these RNG with formal statistical tests. The RNGs we will explore include:

* Numpy BitGenerator (PCG64)
* RANDU
* Middle Squares

The statistical tests we will use are:

* Chi Squared for goodness of fit (Uniforms)
* Means run test for independence
* Autocorrelation test for independence

In addition sometimes a simple eye test can give a lot of insight! 

## Background - Random Number Generators

### Numpy BitGenerator (PCG64)
This is the default RNG used in Python's numpy module. It is a PCG, which is short for permuted congruential generator. Developed in 2014, essentially it follows a linear congruential generator as a state-transition function, then uses permutation function as an output function.

### Randu
Randu is a linear congruential pseudorandom number generator of the Parkâ€“Miller type, and was developed in the 1960s. As mentioned in the course, drawbacks of the generator include correlation between points. In fact, each point lies in one of a set of 15 parallel planes 2^31 apart.

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_j = \frac{V_{j}}{2^{31}}">

### Middle Squares
The midsquares method was developed by Von Neumann in 1949. It is an arithmetic method that takes a seed number and generates the next number by taking the middle n digits of the seed number, and squaring it. In this case, we use n=4. Example (if n=4:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X0 = 6100, X0^2 = 37*2100*00">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X1 = 2100, X1^2 = 04*4100*00">
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=R_{i}=\frac{X_{i}}{1000}">

and so on..

## Background - Statistical Tests

### Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit Test for Correlation
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H0: R_{1},R_{2}...R_{n} are Unif(0,1)">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\chi_{0}^{2} = \sum_{i=1}^{k}\frac{(O_{i}-E_{i})^2}{E_{i}}">

if <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\chi_{0}^{2}<=\chi_{a,k-1}^{2}">, we fail to reject <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=H0">
